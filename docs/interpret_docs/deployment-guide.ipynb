    "The package `interpret` is handy for data scientists in the prototyping and model building phase. However the number of dependencies required is exhaustive, and for production environments it's often better to select only the components you need for installation. Sometimes you'll also have a better understanding of what dependency versions can work with `interpret` and your environment, even if we don't officially support it. As such we offer options `interpret` and `interpret-core` for both scenarios."
