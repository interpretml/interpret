    "At their core, EBMs are generalized additive models where the score contributions from individual features and interactions are added together to make a prediction. Each individual score contribution is determined using a lookup table. Before doing the lookup, we first need to discretize continuous features and assign bin indexes to categorical features.\n",

In this example, the dataset has 3 unique values in the continuous feature: 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. To separate these 3 values into 3 bins, we require 2 cut points. The EBM has chosen the cut points of 7.5 and 8.5, but it could have chosen any cut point values between 7.0 to 8.0 and between 8.0 to 9.0.\n",

    "EBMs also include 2 special bins: the missing bin, and the unknown bin. The missing bin is the bin that we use if there are any feature values that are missing, like NaN or 'None'. The unknown bin is used whenever we see a categorical value during prediction that was not present in the training set. For example, if our testing dataset had the categorical value \"Vietnam\", or \"Brazil\", then we would use the unknown bin in this example since those countries did not appear in the training set.\n",
