    "## Should I be parameter tuning EBMs (and if so, what parameters should I tune)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the default parameters for EBMs should perform reasonably well on most problems. We recommend training a model with defaults and looking through the learned functions to catch abnormal behavior before parameter tuning -- oftentimes, these graphs help indicate which parameters to tune. Here's some general recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To produce the best models, we generally recommend setting `outer_bags` and `inner_bags` to 25 or more each. This will significantly slow down the training time of the algorithm, and may be infeasible on larger datasets, but tends to produce smoother graphs with marginally higher accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you believe the models might be overfitting (ex: large difference between train and test error, or high degrees of instability in graphs), consider the following options:\n",
    "    - Reduce `max_bins` for smaller datasets, to clump more data together.\n",
    "    - Make the early stopping more aggressive by decreasing `early_stopping_rounds` and increasing `early_stopping_tolerance`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Conversely, for underfit models which appear too conservative, you can do the opposite of the previous suggestions -- increase `max_bins` and make early stopping less aggressive. It might also be helpful to increase the total allowed `max_rounds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If many of the included interaction terms are significant (e.g. learning large values or ranking highly on the overall importance list), there's a chance the 10 interaction terms included by default is insufficient for your dataset. Consider increasing this number. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For general tuning, we recommend sweeping `max_bins` with values between 32 and 1024, and `max_leaves` from 2 to 5. These improvements are normally marginal, but may help significantly on some datasets. "

    "## What does the error bar on an EBM graph mean, and how are they calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "The error bars are rough estimates of the uncertainty of the model in each region of the feature space. A large error bar means that the learned function may have changed substantially with minor changes to the training data, and indicates that the interpretation of the model in that region should be treated with more skepticisim. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the error bar is typically determined by two factors -- the amount of training data in that region of the feature space, and the inherent uncertainty of the learned model. For example, consider this graph of the learned \"Age\" feature from the Adult income dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Age graph](./images/age-graph-adult.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right side of the graph (Ages 70+), the model predictions become unstable, and the error bars become much larger to indicate this uncertainty. From the density graph at the bottom, we can see that this is likely due to the small number of samples in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error estimates are derived through [bagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating). By default, EBM trains 8 different mini-EBMs on random 85% subsamples of the training dataset. The number of mini-EBMs trained is controlled by the `outer_bags` parameter, and the proportion of data sampled is 1 - `validation_size`. The outputs of these models are averaged together to produce the final EBM, and the standard deviation of estimates for each region of the graph is published as the error bar. You can programmatically access the error bar sizes from the `standard_deviations_` property on any EBM."

    "\n",
    "The differences are largely analogous to the differences between [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) and [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression). Like logistic regression, EBMs need to be adapted to the classification setting through the use of the [logistic link function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function). \n",
    "\n",
    "This link is used because probabilities are not additive -- two features cannot each contribute +0.6 probability to a prediction, as the resulting final probability of 1.2 is undefined. The logistic link allows the models to train in the logit space -- where the contribution of each feature can be additive -- and convert back to a bounded probability at prediction time. Therefore, when interpreting the graphs of an `ExplainableBoostingClassifier`, it's important to remember that the y-axis values are in [logits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit). The interpretation of the shape is generally the same -- positive values push the prediction towards a positive label for that class. However, because these graphs are in logarithm space, differences of +1 or +2 are quite significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the regression setting, the interpretation is simpler: the y-axis values are directly in the units of the target. For example, if you are training on housing prices, the y-axis for each graph will represent exactly how many dollars that feature contributes to the final price of a model -- no additional transformations needed!"

Indexing this array returns the function learned for a specific term in the EBM -- for example, `ebm.terms_scores_[0]` will return the array for the first term. Editing this array directly will change all predictions made by the model for that corresponding region of the graph. A nicer API for this with more granular controls will be introduced shortly!"
