# EBM internals

For a reference on the ExplainableBoostingClassifier and ExplainableBoostingRegressor classes, please see [Glassbox EBMs](./ebm.ipynb)

This section is divided into 3 parts that build upon each other:
[Part 1](./ebm-internals-regression.ipynb) Covers regression for pure GAM models (no interactions).
[Part 2](./ebm-internals-classification.ipynb) Covers binary classification with interactions, ordinals, and missing values.
[Part 3](./ebm-internals-multiclass.ipynb) Covers multiclass, and unseen values.
