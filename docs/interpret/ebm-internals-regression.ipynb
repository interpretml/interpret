    "At their core, EBMs are generalized additive models where the score contributions from individual features and interactions are added together to make a prediction. Each individual score contribution is determined using a lookup table. Before doing the lookup, we first need to discretize continuous features and assign bin indexes to categorical features.\n",

In this example, the dataset has 3 unique values in the continuous feature: 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. To separate these 3 values into 3 bins, we require 2 cut points. The EBM has chosen the cut points of 7.5 and 8.5, but it could have chosen any cut point values between 7.0 to 8.0 and between 8.0 to 9.0.\n",

    "When making predictions involving continuous features, the feature values we receive can be anywhere in the continuous range between -infinity and +infinity.

    "\n",
    "If there are any feature values that are equal to a bin cut value, they are placed into the upper bin choice. To convert a continuous feature into bins, we can use the numpy.digitize function with a slight adjustment that we'll see below.\n",

    "EBMs also include 2 special bins: the missing bin, and the unseen bin. The missing bin is the bin that we use if there are any feature values that are missing, like NaN or 'None'. The unseen bin is used whenever we see a categorical value during prediction that was not present in the training set. For example, if our testing dataset had the categorical value \"Vietnam\", or \"Brazil\", then we would use the unseen bin in this example since those countries did not appear in the training set.\n",

If we received a feature value of NaN, then we'd use the score value at index 0. If the feature value was \"Fiji\", we'd use the score value at index 1.
