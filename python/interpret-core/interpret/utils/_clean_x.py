# BIG TODO LIST:
# - review this entire bin.py file
# - write a cython single instance prediction pathway
# - consider re-writing most of this bin.py functionality in cython for anything that gets used during prediction for speed
# - test: clean_dimensions with ma.masked_array... and other stuff in there
# - test: preclean_X with pd.Series with missing values and maybe a categorical -> gets converted as N features and 1 sample
# - test: preclean_X with list that CONTAINS a ma.masked_array sample entry with missing data and without missing data
# - add better processing for ignored columsn where we return the existing data if we can, and we return all None
#  values if not which our caller can detect.  Then unify_data can convert that to int(0) values which should work for
#  all feature types
# - disable 'ignore' columns temporarily.  We need to update C++ to make a distinction because you can have 3 real columns and 5 referencable columsn and our datastructures need to be updated to handle this in C++ first
# - handle the thorny questions of converting float to int for categorical strings
#  - in the object converter, convert all int64/uint64 and all floats objects to float64, then use the floor check
#    and compare with +-9007199254740991 to decide if they should be expressed as integers or floats
#  - after np.unique for categoricals, convert int64 and uint64 types to float64 and then re-run np.unique on those
#    values to figure out if there are collisions in the float64 space for integers.  We actually have more
#    work to do in this case since we'll also get bad reverse indexes with more categories than we have unique values
#    Perhaps we can just detect this scenario in the integer space by checking for 9007199254740991 < abs(x) with
#    integers and if it's true then convert to float64 before calling np.unique again?  It'll be infrequent to have
#    such large integers, and we only need to check with int64 and np.uint64 since they are the only ones that can make non-unique floats
#  - leave bools as "False"/"True", BUT we have a corner case in _densify_object_ndarray if we have mixed types
#    we convert to unicode, and bools become "False"/"True" and then subequently fail the test of being able to
#    be converted to floats, so we need to record the bool types and convert them to 0/1 for the conversion to float
#    test.  First, we can detect if there are any bools via "types = set(map(type, X_col))", then we can
#    find all the bools with np.logical_or(X_col == np.array(False), X_col == np.array(True)) or something like that
#  - strip leading and trailing spaces when attempting to convert to float BUT NOT FOR STRING CATEGORICALS!
#  - def convert_float_category_str(vals):
#        vals = vals.astype(np.float64, copy=False)
#        integerizable = np.logical_and(vals == np.floor(vals), vals.abs() <= THE_MAX_FLOAT)
#        integers = vals[integerizable]
#        floats = vals[~integerizable]
#        integers = integers.astype(np.int64).astype(np.unicode_)
#        floats = integers.astype(np.unicode_) # or perhaps shuttle it to C++
#        objs = np.empty(len(vals), dtype=np.object)
#        np.place(objs, integerizable, integers)
#        np.place(objs, ~integerizable, floats)
#        vals = objs.astype(np.unicode_)
#        return vals
# - add support for a "ordinal_fast" and "nominal_fast".  We would accept these in feature_types as
#   a dict of (int/float -> string) for 'ordinal_fast', and (string -> int/float) for 'nominal_fast'
#   the we'd write our feature_types_in values as "ordinal_fast" and "nominal_fast" and we'd exepct
#   integers in whatever evaluation format we got.  This would allow us to accept a float64 numpy array
#   and have inside that nominal/ordinal/continuous/missing values that would be highly compressed.  Both of these
#   would have restriction in that the numbers would have to be contiguous (maybe allowing for compression??) and
#   would start from 1, with 0 as reserved for missing values.  A big issues is that with this encoding, the
#   system on which we do predict needs to also encode them as integers and they have no flexibility to change
#   that, except perhaps they could edit the model to change from 'nominal_fast' to 'nominal'
#   { "Canada" : 1, "Japan" : 2, "Seychelles" : 3} => string to int mapping -> nominals
#   { 1: "low", 2: "medium", 3: "high" } => int to object(string) mapping -> ordinals
#   We still record these as ["low", "medium", "high"] and ["Canada", "Japan", "Seychelles"] and we use the
#   feature type value to know that these are "ordinal_fast" and "nominal_fast"


# FUTURE TODOS in our callers and in JSON:
# - look into ISO 6093:1985 -> https://www.titanwolf.org/Network/q/4d680399-6711-4742-9900-74a42ad9f5d7/y
# - support "category compression" where we take a number like 10 and compress any categories together that
#   have less than that number of samples.  Internally, this works well for the prior_categories parameter since
#   we can have multiple strings map to identical numbers, so "low" and "medium" can be groups and separate from high
#   with {"low": 1, "medium": 1, "high":2} and in JSON we can record these as [["low", "medium"], "high"]
#   We support different category compressions for pairs or even individual features since we allow
#   separate category definitios per pair axis.  Our unify_columns generator can support these by extracting the
#   raw data once and then applying different category dictionaries to the raw data and then yielding those
#   the caller to the generator can quickly determine which categories we're responding to using the pointer id(..)
#   comparisons without examining all the internal dictionary definitions, and we can minimize
#   work done by having a single object with a single id(..) pointer that is shared between prior_categories objects
#   if they are identical at model load time.
# - if we recieve an unseen float64 value in a 'nominal' or 'ordinal', then check if all the categorical
#   value strings are convertible to float64.  If that's the case then find the mid-point between the categories
#   after they are converted to strings and create a pseudo-continuous value of the feature and figure out where
#   the previously unseen float64 should go.  WE do need to sort the category strings by float64, but we don't
#   to to compute the split points because we can just do a binary search against the categories after they are
#   converted to floats and then look at the distance between the upper and lower category and choose the one
#   that is closest, and choose the upper one if the distance is equal since then the cut would be on the value
#   and we use lower bound semantics (where the value gets into the upper bin if it's exactly the cut value)
# - eventually, we'll want to have an EBMData data frame that'll store just
#   floats and integers and convert strings to integers on the fly as data is added
#   AND more importantly, you could create this EBMData with a reference to a model
#   and then you could populate it with the correct integer mapping, so "low", "medium", "high"
#   get populated internally as 1, 2, 3 IDENTICALLY to the model from which the
#   EBMData frame was created from.  If we get a dataframe from anywhere else then
#   we can't be confident the mapping is identical, and we need to use a dictionary
#   of some kind, either from string to integer or integer to integer to do the mapping
#   so having our own dataframe makes it possible to have faster prediction scenarios
#   Unfortunately, taking a Pandas dataframe as input doesn't allow us to escape the hashtable
#   step, so whehter we get strings or integers is kind of similar in terms of processing speed
#   although hashing strings is slower.
# - the EBMData frame should be constructable by itself without a model reference if it's going to
#   be used to train a model, so we sort of have 2 states:
#   - 1: no model reference, convert strings to integers using hashes on the fly
#   - 2: model reference.  Use the model's dictionary mapping initially, but allow new strings or integers
#     to be added as necessary, but anything below what the model knows about we map diretly to the right integers
# - we should create post-model modification routines so someone could construct an integer based
#   ordinal/categorical and build their model and evaluate it efficiently, BUT when they want
#   to view the model they can replace the "1", "2", "3" values with "low", "medium", "high" for graphing


# NOTES:
# - IMPORTANT INFO FOR BELOW: All newer hardware (including all Intel processors) use the IEEE-754 floating point
#   standard when encoding floating point numbers.  In IEEE-754, smaller whole integers have perfect representations
#   in float64 representation.  Float64 looses the ability to distinquish between integers though above the number
#   9007199254740991. 9007199254740992 and 9007199254740993 both become 9007199254740992 when converted to float64
#   and back to ints.  All int32 and uint32 values have perfect float64 representation, but there are collisions
#   for int64 and uint64 values above these high numbers.
# - a desirable property for EBM models is that we can serialize them and evaluate them in different
#   programming languages like C++, R, JavaScript, etc
# - ideally, we'd have just 1 serialization format, and JSON is a good choice as that format since we can then
#   load models into JavaScript easily, and it's also well supported accross other languages as well.
# - JSON also has the benefit that it's human readable, which is important for an intelligible model.
# - JSON and JavaScript have fairly limited support for data types.  Only strings and float64 numbers are recognized.
#   There are no integer datatypes in JavaScript or JSON.  This works for us though since we can use strings to
#   encode nominals/ordinals, and float64 values to define 'continuous' cut points.
# - 'continuous' features should always be converted to float64 before discretization because:
#   - float64 is more universal accross programming languages.  Python's float type is a float64.  R only supports
#     float64.  JavaScript is only float64, etc.  GPUs are the excpetion where only float32 are sometimes supported
#     but we only do discretization at the injestion point before any GPUs get used, so that isn't a concern.
#   - our model definition in JSON is exclusively float64, and we don't to add complexity to indicate if a number
#     is a float64 or float32, and even then what would we do with a float32 in JavaScript?
#   - float64 continuous values gives us perfect separation and conversion of float32 values, which isn't true
#     for the inverse
#   - The long double (float80) equivalent is pretty much dead and new hardware doesn't support it.  In the off
#     chance someone has data with this type then we loose some precision and some values which might have been
#     separable will be lumped together, but for continuous values the cut points are somewhat arbitary anyways, so
#     this is acceptable.
#   - Some big int64 or uint64 values collide when converting to float64 for numbers above 9007199254740991,
#     so we loose the ability to distinquish them, but like for float80 values
#     this loss in precision is acceptable since continuous features by nature group similar values together.
#     The problem is worse for float32, so float64 is better in this regard.
# - 'nominal' and 'ordinal' features are pretty compatible between languages when presented to us as strings
#   but the caller can specify that integer/boolean/float values should be treated as 'nominal'/'ordinal' and
#   then things become tricky for a number of reasons:
#   - it's pretty easy in python and in other languages to silently convert integers to floats.  Let's say
#     we have a categorical where the possible values are 1, 2, 3, and 4.1, but 4.1 is very unlikely and might
#     occur zero times in any particular dataset.  If during training our unique values are np.array([1, 2, 3]),
#     but during predict time let's say we observe np.array([1, 2, 3, 4.1]).  Python will silently convert these to
#     floats resulting in np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.1]), and then when we convert to strings we get
#     ["1.0", "2.0", "3.0", "4.1"] instead of our original categories of ["1", "2", "3"], so now none of our
#     categories match.  This would be a very easy mistake to make and would result in a hard to diagnose bug.
#     A solution to this problem of silently converting integers to floats would be to change our text conversion
#     such that floats which are whole numbers are converted to integers in text.  So then we'd get
#     ["1", "2", "3", "4.1"] as our categories.  We can do this efficiently in python and in many other languages
#     by checking if floor(x) == x for float64 values.  I think it's also nicer visually in graphs of categoricals
#     that any numbers are shown as integers when possible
#   - another benefit of making whole number floats as integers is that integer to string conversions are relatively
#     easy to do cross-language, but floats are almost never converted to identical strings the same way across
#     languages since there are many legal conversions.
#     "33.3", "33.299999999999997", "3.3e1", "3.3e+01" are all legal text representations for the float value of 33.3
#   - we have an issue in that all numbers above 9007199254740991 (and in fact some numbers below that) will
#     be equal to their floor, so will appear to be whole numbers.  We don't want 1.0e300 to be converted
#     to an integer, so we need some kind of maximum value above which we change to floating point representation
#     Since integers don't exist in JavaScript, we can't really represent all numbers above 9007199254740991
#     with unique categoricals, so we can't have truely cross-platform integers above that value, so it makes
#     sense for us to make all whole numbers equal to or less than 9007199254740991 integers, and any number
#     above that point as a floating point.  This has the disadvantage that some integers above 9007199254740991
#     will have the same categorical strings and be non-separable, but having some collisions in extreme values
#     is probably better than the alternative of getting different categorical strings in different programming
#     languages where integers do not exist.  By making all numbers larger than 9007199254740991 as floating
#     point values, the caller will at least see that we're using exponential float representations instead of
#     integers, so although they may not understand why we switch to float representation above 9007199254740991
#     it will at least be apparent what is happening so they can correct the issues by converting to strings themselves.
#   - The only way we could guarantee that identical float64 values in different programming languages generate
#     the same text would be if we implemented a float to text converter in C++ (the standard library provides no
#     cross platform guarantees), and if we sent our floating point values into C++ for conversion.  This is possible
#     to do because we only care about performance during predict time for this converstion to strings, and at predict
#     time we already know if a feature is nominal/ordinal/continuous, and presumably there aren't too many
#     categories because otherwise the feature wouldn't be very useful, so we can pass the relatively few floating
#     point values into C++ and get back a single string separated by spaces of the text conversions.
#   - if we're presented with an array of np.object_, we can't give a guarantee that unique inputs will generate unique
#     categories since the caller could present us with int(0) and "0", or some object type who's __str__ function
#     generates a "0".  We can't obviously support generalized object types when we serialize to JSON, or any
#     other cross-language model serialization format.
#   - here's an interesting conundrum.  np.float64(np.float32("1.1")) != np.float64("1.1").  Also,
#     np.float64(np.float32(1.1)) gives "1.100000023841858".  The problem here is that the float32 converter finds
#     the float32 value that is closest to 1.1.  That value is a float though so if you convert that to a float64
#     value all the lower mantissa bits are zeros in the float64 value.  If you take the string "1.1" and convert
#     it to float64 though the converter will find the closest float64 value where the text after the 1.1... isn't
#     required for roundtripping.  That float64 will have non-zero bits in the lower mantissa where the float32
#     value for "1.1" does not, so they are not equal.  This is a problem because if we build an EBM model in one
#     language with a float32 and in annother language with a float64 that is the same value we expect them to have
#     the same nominal or ordinal string, but they don't.  In the language with the float32 value we get "1.1"
#     and in the language with the float64 we get "1.100000023841858" and they don't match.  The solution is to
#     convert all float32 values to float64 in all languages so that we get "1.100000023841858" in both.  This feels
#     odd since str(my_float32) might give "1.1" so it'll be confusing to the caller, but at least we'll get
#     consistent results.  I think we need to make the assumption that the caller has the same binary float
#     represetation in both langauges.  If that's true then any errors are caused by the caller really since
#     they are presenting slightly different data in both languages.  They should be able to resolve it by using
#     float64 everywhere which should be available in all mainstream languages, unlike float32.

#   - Python uses the gold standard for float/string conversion: https://www.netlib.org/fp/dtoa.c
#     https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Python/dtoa.c
#     This code outputs the shortest possible string that uses IEEE 754 "exact rounding" using bankers' rounding
#     which also guarantees rountrips precicely.  This is great for interpretability.  Unfortunatetly this means
#     that we'll need code in the other languages that generates the same strings and for converting back to floats.
#     Fortunately the python C++ code is available and we can use that to get the exact same conversions and make
#     that available in other languages to call into the C++ to harmonize floating point formats.
#     Python is our premier language and has poor performance if you try to do operations in loops, so we'll
#     force all the other platforms to conform to python specifications.
#   - when we recieve bool values in python we can probably keep the python string representations of "False" and "True".
#     Unlike float64 values, there are just 2 possible bool values and we express them as JavaScript bool items,
#     and with just 2 possible values there are no issues with different
#     hard to standardize string formats.  I like giving the user a little more context of the underlying value in
#     the graphs, and "True", "False" are a bit nicer than "false" and "true" or "FALSE" and "TRUE"
#   - If our caller gives us strings [" a ", "a"] we will consider those to be two separate categories since the caller
#     could have some requirement to keep these as separate categories.  Eliminating the whitespace makes it impossible
#     for our caller to differentiate these.  If the caller wants these to be the same string then they can preprocess this
#     aspect themselves.
# - np.unique has some issues.  It doesn't like None values.  It considers int(4) and float(4.0) to be identical
#   it sucks in performance with np.object_ arrays since it uses python comparers.  It doesn't call
#   __str__ on objects, so we get collisions if the object later converts to a string that is already a category.
#   If there are many np.nan values, then the uniques array has many np.nan entries!  We've fixed all of these
#   by filtering out None and np.nan values, and we've converted objects to a strong types
# - If we aren't given a feature type and we get data that is just [0, 1], should we treat this as
#   'nominal' or a 'continuous' value with a split at 0.5?  We'd rather our graphs be bar graphs showing
#   a bar for 0 and annother bar for 1, which implies nominal, but this has a problem if the
#   feature can rarely be something like 1.1.  Maybe we just never saw a 1.1 in our data even though
#   it can occur.  If this happens then a string label of 1.1 doesn't match '1' and we fail.  If
#   we treated data this way then it wouldn't really be legal for production systems to not
#   specify one of the feature types since an unlikely occurence could produce a nominal type
#   from a continuous type and then fail at predict time.  Our solution is if we see new categories at predict time
#   to check if the new categories are convertible to float64 and if that's true and if all the other prior categories
#   that we saw during fit time are also convertible to float64, then we are allowed to switch to treating them as continuous
#   during predict time.  This way we get to have nice bar graphs of '0' and '1', but we won't generate an error
#   if we see 1.1 at predict time since it gets put into the [0.5 +inf) bin.  We treat
#   [0, 1, 2] and [0, 1, 9] and [1.1, 2.2] the same way and have a threshold of categories below which we treat these
#   as cateogoricals during training.
# - If we recieve pure floats from the caller we'll either generate a continuous feature_type and any differences
#   in the floating point cut points should be fairly minor.  Alternatively, we'll get a 'nominal' which is
#   also ok since our floating point strings won't match the ones at fit time and then they'll be converted to
#   continuous values and very likely end up in the same bin as the original floats as they'll be very close in value
#   since we soft-convert nominals with all float64 values into continuous values when necessary/possible
# - Let's say we get the strings ['0', '00', '0.0', '0.0e10'].  If the caller forced this as a nominal we'd have
#   4 values, but if we decided that this should be a 'continuous_auto' value then we'd be converting this to only
#   one floating point value, which makes it useless.  What this is highlighting is that our unique cutoff point
#   where we choose whether a feature should be 'nominal_auto' or 'continuous_auto' should be decided by the number
#   of unique float64 values that the strings convert into.  Hopefully different platforms get the same floating point
#   values based on string inputs, which is annother reason why we should have a consistent C++ implementation.
# - we use the terms ordinal and nominal to indicate different types of categoricals
#   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_data).  A lot of ML pacakges use categorical instead of the more
#   specific term nominal since they don't support ordinals (requiring ordinal data to be handled as
#   continuous/numerical).  We however, being an interpretable package, want to have a built in oridinal
#   feature type so that we can display "low", "medium", "high" instead of 1, 2, 3 on graphs, so
#   it makes sense for us to make the distinction of having nominal and ordinal features which are both categoricals
#   This also aligns nicely with the pandas.CategoricalDtype which is used to specify both ordinals and nominals.
